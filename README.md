## Motivation
Our motivation for building this website was because we were all tired of scrolling through Netflix and Hulu for hours just to find a good show to watch. Sometime when we found something watch it wasn't a great of a show. So we decided why don't we make a website that helps everyone find a shows or movie easier and something they'll enjoy.
