# OneStop-Entertainment-App

**Application Description**

The database of movies and tv shows is so overwhelmingly enormous with new ones being added in every passing day. Even an enthusiastic movie buff would find himself or herself lost trying to keep track which movie or tv show is streaming on which platform and to seek information about movie cast, movie overview or plot, its rating, etc.<br> 
Hence we felt motivated to create an online database which would include information and statistics about both movies and tv shows as well as about actors, directors and other film industry professionals. This information can include lists of cast and crew members, movie release dates, box office performance, movie plot, trailers, biographies of actors and directors and other trivia related to the movie.<br> 
Because of the time constraint, for now we have only managed to include the display feature of movies and tv shows posters, their titles, their ratings and a short overview about them along with the available trailers. In near future, we plan to add some more features to the database like information about streaming platform of each movie and its link, providing information about its cast and their filmography and relevant links, mentioning the current movie shows running in local theatre etc.
